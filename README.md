Diagnostic Analysis of NHS Appointments Data 2021-22
## Scenario:
The NHS must expand its infrastructure and resources to match its increasing population capacity. For this, it needs to budget correctly. When deciding on budget allotment, the NHS must understand the utilisation trends of each component in its network. Therefore, reducing or eliminating missed appointments would be beneficial financially as well as socially. The government needs a data-informed approach to decide how best to handle this problem. At this stage of the project, the two main questions posed by the NHS are:
####   Has there been adequate staff and capacity in the networks?
####   What was the actual utilisation of resources?

## The suggested approach for the analysis and output created is as follows:
_"Data ingestion, wrangling, and modelling." 
"Visualisation and predictions."
"Jupyter Notebook: a clean, easy-to-understand, and structured Notebook that has a logical flow of end-to-end analysis."
"Tech Report."_
